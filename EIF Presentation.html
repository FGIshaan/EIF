                <p class="font-size-change">To start making my website, I had to search for several videos to learn the basics. I used this video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=2791s" target="_blank">(<span class="reference">HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro</span>)</a> to know what apps/programs I had to use in order to make a website. The program of choice is called 'VS Code'. I decided to use VS Code because this person and many others recommended it. After using it, I got the beginner's level coding, and I learned things like how to make a button, how to save different files, and how to structure a webpage. As I progressed by watching different videos, I gained more knowledge about making a website, including creating responsive layouts, integrating multimedia elements, and understanding the importance of semantic HTML.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-image">
                <p>I searched up how to add a header and change the background color. I found this helpful video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxWf493en4&t=5s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org" target="_blank">HTML Tutorial - How to Make a Super Simple Website</a> and also referred to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp" target="_blank">How TO - Make a Website</a> on W3Schools. These resources provided step-by-step guidance on setting up the basic structure of my website, including adding navigation bars, creating content sections, and styling elements using CSS. They also introduced me to best practices in web design, such as keeping a consistent style, ensuring readability, and optimizing the site for different devices.</p>

            <div class="paragraph-image">
                <p>At this stage, I searched up different color combinations for the website and changed the colors accordingly. I used this website - <a href="https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/" target="_blank">50 Gorgeous Color Schemes From Award-Winning Websites</a> to get good color combinations for the website. This resource was invaluable because it showcased various color palettes that evoke different emotions and user experiences. By experimenting with these combinations, I learned how colors can enhance the visual appeal and usability of a website. I also understood the significance of color contrast for accessibility, ensuring that my website is inclusive for all users.</p>

                <p>At the end, I copied and pasted all of my work from my history document and adjusted it by paragraph and references. This process involved meticulously organizing the content to ensure that each section flowed logically and was easy to read. I also double-checked the hyperlinks to make sure they were correctly linked to the sources. This step taught me the importance of thorough proofreading and editing in web development, as well as the need for a clean and intuitive layout that guides the user through the information effortlessly.</p>

                <p>I used the help from this website - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite" target="_blank">The Citation element</a> to add hyperlink references at the end of the website. This element is crucial for providing proper credit to sources and enhancing the credibility of the content. Learning how to implement citations correctly also helped me understand the ethical aspects of web content creation, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the work of others and avoiding plagiarism.</p>

                <p>This is how the website looked in the end. I was helped by my friends for the color schemes and the overall looks of the website itself. The website was published online using GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This platform was recommended by a YouTuber in a video titled "Host website on GitHub for free in just 2 mins". It was really easy to publish the website. All it took was about 5 minutes for me to publish the website on the internet. This step not only introduced me to version control with Git but also highlighted the convenience of using GitHub Pages for hosting static websites. It was a straightforward process that opened up possibilities for future web projects.</p>

                <p>Even when I finished making my custom domain and successfully uploading it on the internet, I encountered an error 404 page. I was really confused at this step because I did not know what to do. I searched around the internet to find another person with the same problem and, after doing some research, I was able to fix this error. I used this video to fix this error - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QU3kLFPdg&t=434s" target="_blank">How to put an HTML website online (on the Internet)</a>. This video is by the same person whose video helped me start making my website. Troubleshooting this issue taught me problem-solving skills and the importance of perseverance. It also made me aware of common pitfalls in web development and how to address them effectively.</p>
